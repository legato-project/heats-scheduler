# HEATS scheduler

This repository hosts the source code of HEATS, a heterogeneity and energy aware scheduler developed for Kubernetes.
Its architecture and implementation are described in the paper *"HEATS: Heterogeneity-and Energy-Aware Task-Based Scheduling"*, to appear in the proceeding of the [27th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP'19)](https://www.pdp2019.eu). An evaluation of the scheduler itself as well as a comparison with the default Kubernetes scheduler can also be found in the paper.
